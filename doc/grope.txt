Help on using Grope                                                *Grope*

 INTRODUCTION                                                *grope-intro*

Grope uses the builtin |:lvimgrep| command. If there are results, Grope opens
the |location-list| and highlights matches using the |hl-Search| highlight
group.

There are several ways to use Grope:

* The |<plug>GropeWord| map which is mapped to <leader>gw by default. See |mapleader|.
* The |:Grope| command
* The |Grope()| function


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <plug>GropeWord                                         *<plug>GropeWord*

Pressing <leader>gw will grep the |word| under the cursor within the path "**/*"


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 :Grope                                                           *:Grope*
>
  :Grope /search term/ [path]
  :Grope search term [path containing wildcard]
<

Search Term~

Internally, all patterns are delimited, but Grope allows bare search terms for
simplicity. The slash '/' is shown as a delimiter here, but many non-alphanum
characters can be used as a delimiter (but not ^).

NOTE: If the Search Term is enclosed in non-alphanum characters then the
optional path is taken to be everything after the closing delimiter.

Path~

Grope uses a default path of "**/*" but you can override this by providing a path
as the final argument. For Grope to recognise this as a path and not another
search term, ensure that it includes a |wildcard|. If your path contains
spaces, escape them with '\'.

Examples~

>
  :Grope ^function
<

Finds all function definitions in all files. To limit it to just vim files in
the current directory:

>
  :Grope ^function *.vim
<

To search all vim files in all directories:

>
  :Grope ^function **/*.vim
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Grope()                                                         *Grope()*

>
  call Grope("search terms [path]")
<

The |:Grope| command simply calls Grope() with all arguments quoted inside a
single string.
